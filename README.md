### About me:

üëã Hello there! I'm Denys, a software enthusiast hailing from Kyiv, Ukraine. At 20 years old, I'm already on a journey to carve out my place in the dynamic world of technology.

üéì I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Kyiv Polytechnical Institute, where I honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. My thirst for knowledge led me to further specialize through a dedicated .NET developer course at EPAM company.

üí° My journey in the software realm has been fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a deep-rooted passion for crafting elegant solutions. I was interested in various programming languages like C++ and Python, exploring the vast coding landscape. However, it was when I delved into .NET/C# that I found my programming home. The elegant simplicity and endless possibilities of this tech stack have captured my heart, and I'm excited to keep pushing further in this direction

üåç Being a tech enthusiast isn't just about the code; it's also about communication and collaboration. With an Upper-Intermediate (B2) level of English proficiency. I believe that effective communication is the foundation of successful software development, and I'm genuinely looking forward to gaining more real-world experience in communicating in English while working. It's a chance for me to enhance not only my technical skills but also my language proficiency in a practical setting.

üîç Currently, I'm on the lookout for a Trainee/Junior position as a .NET developer. I'm eager to channel my energy and knowledge into real-world projects, contribute to meaningful solutions, and continue my growth journey alongside a team of like-minded individuals.
